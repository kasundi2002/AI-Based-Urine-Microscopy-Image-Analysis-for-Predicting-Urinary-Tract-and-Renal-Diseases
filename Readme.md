AI-Based Urine Microscopy Image Analysis for Predicting Urinary Tract and Renal Diseases 

This research project presents a comprehensive AI-powered diagnostic system designed to analyze urine microscopy images and predict urinary tract and renal diseases.The system integrates deep learning–based image analysis with patient metadata to deliver accurate, personalized, and explainable clinical insights. It detects and classifies key urine sediment components such as RBCs (isomorphic/dysmorphic), WBCs, casts, crystals, and bacteria (cocci, bacilli, spirochetes), yeast supporting early identification of conditions like UTIs, hematuria, glomerulonephritis, and kidney stone formation. 

Project Highlights Deep learning models for multi-particle detection (YOLO, CNN-based classifiers). RBC morphology analysis for identifying glomerular vs. non-glomerular bleeding. Cast, crystal, and bacterial subtype classification for multi-disease prediction. Multimodal fusion combining image features with patient metadata. Explainable AI outputs and real-time diagnostic reports. Web-based interface for clinicians and patients, supporting metadata entry and result visualization.
