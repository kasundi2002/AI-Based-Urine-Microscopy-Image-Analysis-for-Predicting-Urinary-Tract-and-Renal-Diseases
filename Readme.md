# 🧪 **AI-Based Urine Microscopy Image Analysis for Predicting Urinary Tract and Renal Diseases**

This project presents a comprehensive **AI-powered diagnostic system** designed to analyze urine microscopy images and predict urinary tract and renal diseases.  
The system integrates **deep learning–based image analysis** with **patient metadata**, delivering **accurate, personalized, and explainable clinical insights**.

It detects and classifies key urine sediment components such as **_RBCs (isomorphic/dysmorphic), WBCs, casts, crystals, bacteria (cocci, bacilli, spirochetes), and yeast_**, enabling early prediction of **UTIs, hematuria, glomerulonephritis, and kidney stone formation**.
